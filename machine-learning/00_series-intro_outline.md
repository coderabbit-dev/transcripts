# Series Intro Outline

Still looking at ideas more than syntax/diction at this point.

## Code Rabbit Intro
* I'm guessing we'll have some sort of standardized theme music/opening animation here.

## What is machine learning?
* Machine Learning is the process of using agorithms to automatically analyze data to
  make predictions or identify interesting trends
  * The term "data" used to refer to tables of facts and figures
  * "Data" can now mean anything that has been recorded
    * Pictures of cats, daily rainfall, the words in a novel, the number of views on a video
* What sort of trends and predictions? (We'll probably only use a few of these)
  * Companies use machine learning to identify which employees are most likely to quit their jobs
  * Genetecists use machine learning to predict how genes in your DNA will express themselves
  * advertisers use machine learning to choose which ad appeals most to you
  * Real Estate companies use machine learning to predict the price of a house
  * The NSA uses machine learning to identify potential threats to US citizens
  * Meteorologists use machine learning to predict the weather.
  * Youtube uses machine learning to idenify which videos you might want to watch
  * Amazon uses machine learning to predict what products you are most interested in
  * Personal assistants use machine learning to both understand commands and use those commands
    to give the user useful information
## Why is machine learning so important/powerful?
* Machine Learning enables computers to do things that only humans could do up until recently
  * Recognize faces and voices, drive cars, 
* Machine Learning makes things previously done by computers faster, more accurate, and automatic
* Machine Learning is continually becoming more powerful
  * Computers are becoming faster and memory is becoming cheaper
  * Companies are becoming more creative with what they consider data
    * See points on pictures of cats, etc. above
  * Companies have realized the importance of data and are now collecting more than ever.
## Conclusion
* A seasoned machine learning practitioner can get computers to do things that are impossible 
  without machine learning
* The high level of interest and talent involved the field of machine learning insures that
  applications will continue to get more impressive in the future.
