# Proposed Series Structure

## Intro
1. What is machine learning?
    * Define Machine Learning
    * Why is it important?
 
## Machine Learning Basics

I'm actually not sure where we would like to start

2. The anatomy of a dataset
    * Tabular vs non-tabular data
    * Independend and Dependent variables
3. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
4. Supervised Learning: Regression and Classification
5. Interpreting Results
    * Precision vs. Recall
    * Standard Error
    * Overfitting
    * Correlation vs. Causation
